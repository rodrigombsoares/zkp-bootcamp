In your teams discuss the sudoku example from the previous homework.  
- **Does sudoku.ts solve the puzzle?**    
	A: No, it just checks the solution
- **Which lines in sudoku.ts indicate that a solution is correct**   
	A: 64-81
- **Is it possible to submit a correct solution, but have the proof rejected as false?**
	A: Yes, if the solution is a correct sudoku solution, but not a solution for `sudokuInstance`
- **If the prover altered the code, could they cheat and claim they had a solution, when in fact they didn't?**
	A: Probably yes, since the prover can make a proof that returns true
